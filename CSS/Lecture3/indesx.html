        Meet the Developer Behind the Code — <br>
        Hey! I'm Sasanka 👋 — a computer science student and aspiring software engineer who enjoys building practical, well-structured applications that solve real-world problems.<br><br>
        I work with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, and I'm actively strengthening my skills in full-stack development, data structures, and system thinking, with hands-on experience in Python, Java, and AI/ML.<br><br>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, planning new technical projects, and watching anime, often drawing creative inspiration from each.<br><br>
        These experiences sharpened my ability to frame problems, collaborate effectively, and execute under constraints—skills I carry into every project I build.
