    <!--What is meta data and UTF-8? 
    Answer: 
           Meta Data:  
    The <meta> tag provides information about a web page (metadata), such as its character set, author, or description. It is not displayed on the page but helps browsers and search engines understand the content.
           UTF-8:  
    UTF-8 is a character encoding standard that supports a wide range of characters, including letters, symbols, and emojis, making it ideal for global web content.-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--What is viewport ?
    Answer: 
    <meta name="viewport">:  
    This tag controls the page's scaling and layout on different devices.  
    -width=device-width: Sets the width to match the device's screen size.  
    -initial-scale=1.0: Sets the default zoom level to 100%.  
    It ensures the page is responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices.-->
